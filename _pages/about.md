Hi! I am Minsuk (or Min) :wave:, an incoming a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology.

I am interested in the field of Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization, particularly in how humans perceive images and the biases involved. By studying this interdisciplinary field, I believe that combining social sciences with computing can greatly enhance our understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, my goal is to develop a thorough insight into human vision and contribute to designing effective visualizations for the public.

I received my Bachelor's degree from Seoul National University, studying in Computer Science and Engineering Department. I have participated as an undergraduate research intern in SNU HCIL, under professor Jinwook Seo.
