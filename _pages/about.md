The incredible journey of AI, powered by the dedication of many, has ignited my passion in two key areas. I'm deeply interested in <u>Human-Centered AI</u>, where the goal is to imbue AI with the essence of human knowledge. Additionally, I'm captivated by the potential of <u> Information Visualization</u>, which becomes a powerful tool to enhance explain and understand AI.

Ultimately, my goal is to foster a mutually beneficial relationship between humanity and AI, which facitiates each one's growth.
