Hi! I am Minsuk (or Min) :wave:, an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization, focusing on how humans perceive and interact with visualizations. By exploring this interdisciplinary field, I aim to combine social sciences with computing to enhance our understanding of human behavior. My goal is to develop a thorough insight into human vision and contribute to designing effective visualizations for the public.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University, where I interned at the SNU HCIL under Professor Jinwook Seo.
