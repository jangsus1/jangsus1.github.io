Hi! I am Minsuk (or Min) :wave:, an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization, focusing on how humans perceive and interact with visualizations. By exploring this interdisciplinary field, I aim to combine social sciences with computing to enhance our understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, my goal is to develop a thorough insight into human vision and contribute to designing effective visualizations for the public.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Seoul National University, where I studied in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. During my undergraduate studies, I participated as a research intern in the SNU HCIL under Professor Jinwook Seo.
