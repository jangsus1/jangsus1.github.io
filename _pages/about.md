Hi! I am Minsuk :wave:, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

My research centers on Information Visualization and Visual Processing, focusing on how people and machines interpret and reason with visual data. I conduct empirical studies of visual attention and cognitive behaviors during chart reading to understand the mechanisms behind comprehension and belief formation. I also explore how these insights can inform AI—developing saliency prediction models and evaluating large language models (LLMs) on visualization understanding.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University, where I interned at the SNU HCIL under Professor Jinwook Seo.
